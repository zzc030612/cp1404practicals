Estimations for Practical Tasks

Throughout the course, my accuracy in estimating practical tasks steadily improved. Initially, there was a learning curve in gauging the time and effort required for each task. However, with consistent practice and feedback, I honed my ability to provide more accurate estimates .

Code Reviews

Participating in both sides of code reviews has been an invaluable learning experience. When my code was reviewed, I gained insights into alternative approaches, best practices, and potential improvements. Conversely, reviewing others' code allowed me to develop a critical eye for identifying issues, providing constructive feedback, and understanding diverse coding styles. This reciprocal process has not only improved the quality of my code but also broadened my understanding of effective programming practices.

Practical Tasks

If I were in charge of this subject, I would make some changes to the practical tasks. Introducing collaborative tasks that encourage teamwork and code sharing enhances the overall learning experience.
